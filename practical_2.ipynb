        "*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Explores a graph level by level to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph or to traverse all nodes systematically.\n",
        "    *   **Implementation:** Utilized a `collections.deque` as a queue and a set for visited nodes.\n",
        "    *   **Demonstrated Output:** For a given graph, BFS traversal from node 'A' resulted in `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`, showcasing its level-by-level exploration.\n",
        "*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically used for pathfinding, topological sorting, or cycle detection.\n",
        "    *   **Implementation:** Utilized a Python list as a stack and a set for visited nodes.\n",
        "    *   **Demonstrated Output:** For the same graph, DFS traversal from node 'A' resulted in `['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'C']`, demonstrating its deep exploration before backtracking.\n",
        "*   **A\\* Search:**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Finds the shortest path between a start and a goal node in a graph, considering both the cost to reach a node (g-score) and the estimated cost to reach the goal from that node (heuristic/h-score).\n",
        "    *   **Implementation:** Used a 10x10 grid with obstacles, the Manhattan distance as the heuristic function, and `heapq` for priority queue management based on `f_score` (g-score + h-score).\n",
        "    *   **Demonstrated Output:** Found a path from `(0, 0)` to `(9, 9)` on the grid, avoiding obstacles. The path found was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), ..., (9, 9)]` with a total cost of `18`.\n",
        "*   **Minimax Algorithm:**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** A decision-making algorithm used in game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.\n",
        "    *   **Implementation:** Modeled for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, including functions for game state representation, possible moves, and a utility function to evaluate terminal states (1 for 'X' win, -1 for 'O' win, 0 for draw). The `minimax` function recursively explored game states.\n",
        "    *   **Demonstrated Output:**\n",
        "        *   From an initial empty board, the algorithm identified an optimal move for 'X' (e.g., `(0, 0)`) with an evaluation of `0`, indicating a guaranteed draw with optimal play.\n",
        "        *   In a mid-game scenario, it correctly identified an optimal move for 'X' (e.g., `(1, 1)`) that led to a winning position with an evaluation of `1`.\n",

        "*   Further enhancements could include implementing variations like iterative deepening DFS, bidirectional BFS, or A\\* with different heuristics and obstacle types. For Minimax, incorporating Alpha-Beta Pruning would significantly improve performance.\n"
